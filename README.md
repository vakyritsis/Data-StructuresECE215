#Data Structures Projects

Welcome to the repository for my Data Structures class projects! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms covered throughout the course.

##Class Information
This repository is a collection of projects completed as part of the ECE215 Data Structures course at University of Thessaly.
This course provides students with an introduction to fundamental data structures and main sorting and searching techniques. Covered topics include:

- Introduction to asymptotic analysis, worst-case, average, and amortized performance.
- Basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, FIFO queues, double-ended queues, static and dynamic trees, and their traversals.
- Binary search and comparative analysis of sorting algorithms (Insertion, Selection, Bubble, Cocktail, Quick, Heap, Merge) and distribution-based sorting algorithms (Bucket, Radix, LSD Radix).
- Selection and order statistics.
- Ordered dictionaries, including balanced trees (AVL, (a,b), Red-Black) and digital trees (Trie, PATRICIA).
- Union-Find on disjoint sets.
- Introduction to hashing and unordered dictionaries, such as hashing with chaining, open addressing, rehashing, and extendible hashing.
- Skip lists, Splay trees, Treaps, Priority queues (Binary, Fibonacci).

##Projects
Each of the project contains the source code for each exercise of the homework and tests to validate our results. Test were provided by the instructor of the class.
